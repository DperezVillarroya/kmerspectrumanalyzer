==============

Purpose
    This package contains scripts that summarize, visualize, and 
    interpret the kmer spectrum (the histogram of abundances of 
    oligonucleotide patterns of fixed length) of short-read 
    sequence datasets.  

Prerequisites
    This package depends on numpy, scipy, matplotlib, and 
    the University of Maryland's Jellyfish kmer counting library.

    A paper describing interpreting the results of kmercounting has
    been submitted Mar 2013
